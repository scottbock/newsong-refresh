				<h2>What to Expect</h2>
				<h4>At New Song, you will find a warm, friendly atmosphere with no expectation to look a certain way. Dress casually or dress up. We are more interested in your readiness to meet with God than with your ability to impress us. In our worship service, you can expect Christ-Centered preaching that seeks to explain the meaning of Bible passages and how they apply to your everyday life. While some sermons may be topical, most will be a part of a larger sermon series based on books of the Bible. Our worship music is contemporary and features new songs, but also includes modernized hymns from the past. Our name “New Song” reveals how much we like to sing and how we have been blessed with talented musicians to lead us in worship. Our service includes elements which have been an important part of the worship by God’s people throughout the ages (Call to Worship, Confession of Sin, Assurance of Pardon, Corporate Prayer, etc.). We hope you will visit us soon and experience the presence of God in worship.</h4>

				<h2>The PCA</h2>
				<h4>The Presbyterian Church in America (PCA) was formed in 1973 to be a denomination that is “Faithful to the Scriptures, True to the Reformed Faith, and Obedient to the Great Commission.”
		The PCA is an evangelical denomination in that we proclaim the gospel of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. The word “evangelical” comes from the Greek word meaning “good news.” We desire all people to trust in the saving work of Jesus and enjoy eternal life in him.
		The PCA is a reformed denomination in that we believe in the biblical truth proclaimed during the Protestant Reformation. The Word of God, rather than tradition, is the only guide for the Church. God alone saves through his immeasurable mercy and according to his sovereign plan. We believe the system of doctrine taught in the Bible is summarized well in the Westminster Confession of Faith with the Larger and Shorter Catechisms.
		The PCA is a Presbyterian denomination in that we have a representative form of church government. A local church is governed by a “Session” comprised of elders (i.e., “presbyters”) elected by the members of the congregation. Pastors and representatives of local churches in a region form a “Presbytery.” Representatives of Presbyteries and local churches meet annually at a “General Assembly.”
					The General Assembly Committees and Agencies help local churches combine their efforts and resources to advance God’s Kingdom more effectively.</h4>
